# 🌎 Cosmic Creations - Interactive 3D Solar System Simulation

A stunning, production-ready 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js, React, and TypeScript. This project demonstrates advanced 3D graphics programming, real-time animation, and interactive user interface development with beautiful cosmic-themed design.

## ✨ Features

### Core 3D Implementation
- **Realistic Solar System**: Accurate scaling and positioning of all 8 planets plus the Sun
- **Physics-Based Orbits**: Realistic orbital mechanics with proper relative speeds
- **Individual Planet Control**: Adjust each planet's orbital speed independently (0-2x normal speed)
- **Professional Lighting**: Ambient, directional, and point lighting for realistic shadows
- **Saturn's Rings**: Detailed ring system with proper transparency and positioning
- **Cosmic Starfield**: Beautiful animated starfield background

### Interactive Controls
- **Master Controls**: Play/pause simulation with real-time speed adjustments
- **Individual Planet Speeds**: Dedicated sliders for each planet with color-coded feedback
- **Camera Controls**: Mouse-driven camera movement for different viewing angles
- **Reset Function**: Restore all planets to default speeds instantly

### Visual Design - Cosmic Creations Theme
- **Cosmic Branding**: Beautiful "🌎 Cosmic Creations" branding with gradient effects
- **Glass-Morphism UI**: Modern, translucent control panels with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Rich cosmic gradients from deep space blacks to purple nebulas
- **Smooth Animations**: 60 FPS performance with optimized rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Professional Footer**: "Made with ❤️ by Pratyush © 2024 All Rights Reserved"

## 🚀 Technical Specifications
